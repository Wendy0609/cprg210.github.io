## Finding correct syntax
A general strategy for finding the correct syntax for HTML or CSS:
1. Don't memorize; you will naturally remember through repetition.
2. Search the internet with a term such as: `[enitity name] [entity type]`.
3. In the results, skip past "W3Schools" and scroll to the top "Mozilla Developer Network" link. It will usually have examples of the proper syntax with descriptions.

### Examples
- HTML
  - `img tag` or `img element`
  - `a tag` or `a element`
- CSS
  - `width property`
  - `font-size property`
