## Lecture: Flexbox navigation
[Example Flexbox Navigation](https://codepen.io/browsertherapy/pen/BaBXjVL)

Learning the `flex` shorthand property:
- `flex-grow`
- `flex-shrink`
- `flex-basis`

### Live-code Objectives
1. Conventional navigation HTML structure.
2. Resetting default list styles.
3. Using the `flex` property for horizontal navigation.
4. Using the box model to make our links more "buttony"

### Activity: 
You will be working in pairs. Find examples of primary navigation online and try building your own navigation bar for your project. 
- What are the common links? 
- Where are they usually located on the page?
- Are there any components you can add to your navigation?

## Lecture: Pseudo-selectors and HSL
Adding rollover and click effects with `:hover` and `:active`. HSL (Tony's favourite color mode) will help us keep things pretty.

### Live-code objectives
- Choosing color components for our effects.
- How many ways can we add feedback to our navigation bar?
  - Adding an underline on hover.
  - Change `background-color` (with a matching `color`) on click.

### Activity 2
You will be working in pairs. Find examples of hover and click effects online. Are there any effects you can add to your navigation?

## Mid-day Huddle
- who needs help?
- any pivots?
- any show-and-tell?

## Taking off the Codepen training wheels
The objective this afternoon is to migrate the Codepen of your current project onto your file system.
### Objectives
1. Choose a location on your files system to store your CPRG 210 projects.
2. Create a new folder for the web page you've been working on so far. This is where we will be storing our eventual website.
3. Create an `index.html` file in the root of this directory and move your Codepen code into this file:
    - HTML panel -> inside the `<body>` tag
    - CSS Panel -> inside a `<style>` just before the closing `</head>` tag.

### Naming conventions (for reference)
- Files should be named consistently
- File names should be short but descriptive (<25 characters)
- Avoid special characters or spaces in a file name
- Underscores or hyphens instead of spaces
- Use lower case characters when possible
- Default file name/location for html: /index.html
- Default file name/location for documentation README: /README.md
- Wfor when eventually move our embedded CSS and JS into linked files:
  - Default file name/location for css: /css/styles.css or /css/main.css
  - Default file name/location for js: /js/app.js or /js/index.js

## Activity: Creating our local project
You will be working in teams. By the end of the day you should have a complete and working `index.html` to start off our Git journey in the next class.
