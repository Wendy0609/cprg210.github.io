## Goals
- what will we have to show for it at the end of the day? We will take the blog post from yesterday and then:
  1. make our text pretty
  2. make it centered
  3. add a page header
  4. turn that header into a hero section
- why should I care?

## Lecture/Live-code: Web typography
### Objectives
Using the text example from yesterday, we will:
- Use the font inspector to investigate the font settings of a website.
- Change the default font.
- Balance `font-size`, line length (`width`) and `line-height`
- Add an HTML image and float text around it
- Make it minimally responsive

## Activity 1: Brute-force a solution
This will be a paired activity.

The "blog post" you create can be on any topic but keep your text readable:
- short paragraphs
- lots of headings
- bulleted or numbered lists where appropriate

## Lecture/Live-code: Page Header
### Objectives
Continuing with your project, try the following:
- Create a `header` section.
- Add a logo as an HTML image ([example](https://acidtone.github.io/images/bt-logo.svg)) with a company title that is left-aligned.
- Lay out the header so that the company name ([Tony's random band name generator](https://acidtone.github.io/namor/)) sits to the right of the logo.
- Change the colour of the `header` background. Try improving this with a `linear-gradient()`.

## Activity 2: Brute-force a solution
You will be working in pairs.
- Try creating a header similar to the Instructor example.
- Also, find examples of page headers in the wild.
- What are some of the design patterns (conventions you're seeing).
- How will you adapt that to your project? What elements/properties are they using? How will you find this information?
- Try emulating (i.e. coding) one or two of these effects into your project.

## Mid-day Huddle
- who needs help?
- any pivots?
- any show-and-tell?

## Lecture 3: Code Walk-through
- What did we learn?
- What are the best practices
- What can be improved in your code?

[*break*]

## Activity 2: Optimize your code
This will be working in pairs.
- what can be improved?
- what code can be used in future projects?
- what's the best way of making it reusable

## Summary
- any trophies?
- prep for tomorrow?
