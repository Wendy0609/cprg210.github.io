## Goals
- what will we have to show for it at the end of the day? We will take the blog post from yesterday and then:
  1. make our text pretty
  2. make it centered
  3. add a page header
  4. turn that header into a hero section
- why should I care?

## Lecture/Live-code: Web typography
- objectives
  - change the default font
  - balance `font-size`, line length (`width`) and `line-height`
  - add an HTML image and float text around it
  - make it minimally responsive

## Activity 1: Brute-force a solution
This will be a paired activity.

The "blog post" you create can be on any topic but keep your text readable:
- short paragraphs
- lots of headings
- bulleted or numbered lists where appropriate

## Lecture/Live-code: Page Header
- objectives
  - create a `header` section
  - add a logo with a company title that is left-aligned
  - layout the header so that the company name sits to the right of the logo
  - change the colour of the `header` background

[*break*]

## Activity 2: Brute-force a solution
You will be working in pairs.
- find examples of page headers in the wild
- what are some of the design patterns (conventions you're seeing)
- how will you adapt that to your project?

## Mid-day Huddle
- who needs help?
- any pivots?
- any show-and-tell?

[*lunch*]

## Lecture 3: Code Walk-through
- what did we learn?
- what are the best practices
- real-world example?
- what can be improved?

[*break*]

## Activity 2: Opitmize your code
This will be working in pairs.
- what can be improved?
- what code can be used in future projects?
- what's the best way of making it reusable

## Summary
- any trophies?
- prep for tomorrow?
