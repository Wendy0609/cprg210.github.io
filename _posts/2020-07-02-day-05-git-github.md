## Reminders for Tony
1. Put on mic
2. Open Zoom chat
3. Record! Anyone else?

## Prep
- [CLI (command line interface) Cheat Sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/)
- [Configuring Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

## Housekeeping

## Lecture 1: Command line basics
Most of the command line tools we will be using in this course depend greatly on which folder you are in. We will cover the three system commands that help up us navigate the file system.
- `pwd`
  - displays your 'present working directory'. This will usually default to your home folder when you first open your terminal.
- `ls`
  - Lists the contents of your current directory. 
  - The `-l` flag lists extra information and `-a` lists hidden files. `-la` will list extra information and also all hidden files. Examples:
    - `$ ls -l`
    - `$ ls -a`
    - `$ ls -la`
- `cd`: changes your directory based on the path you provide after the command (separated by a space). Examples:
  - `$ cd Documents/cprg210`
  - `$ cd /h/sait/cprg210`
  - `$ cd ..` (moves up one directory)

Quality of life cli tips
- tab: auto-completes file names and directories
- up arrow: browse through command history

### Live-code 1
#### Objectives
- What is the starting directory when you open a terminal on your system?
- What files and directories are in this initial directory?
- What file did you last open? Try to find it using only the terminal.
- What's at the top of your directory structure? How do you get there?
- Using the terminal, find the directory you've chosen to store your cprg 210 projects.

### Activity 1: Navigating the file system
You will be working in teams. Make sure you have installed Git on your system. We will be using Git Bash for this exercise.

Try navigating to various directories on your system to get accustomed to the command line.

## Lecture: Your first git repository (maybe)

### Live-code objectives
- How will you organize your projects?
- If you've just installed Git, set your name and email in the `git config` described in the Prep. 
- Create a git repository for the project you've been working on in the HTML/CSS portion of this course.

### Activity 2
- individual or paired?
- restate objective

## Mid-day Huddle
- who needs help?
- any pivots?
- any show-and-tell?
